# Code of Conduct

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center lead">
  <p class="mb-0">And one of them, a lawyer, asked Jesus a question to test him. "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"" And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.‚Äù</p>

At Missional Digerati, we love God!  That love and passion is the motivation for all that we do.  One way we can demonstrate this love is through how we work with one another.  Jesus calls us to **love our neighbor as ourselves**.  This requires a lot of self sacrifice. It requires a commitment to put our neighbor and their needs before our own.  Imagine a community of skilled professionals working alongside each other striving to put Jesus' words into practice.  A place where everyone is respected and loved.  This is the type of community we want to build around our open source projects!

This is not an easy task.  It will require a commitment from every member in the community, including Missional Digerati's staff, to **love their neighbor as themselves**.  Are you ready to join this community?

{:.text-center}
**In order to foster this type of community, Missional Digerati will enforce the following code of conduct in all of our open source projects.**

### How We Speak

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center lead">
  <p class="mb-0">Gracious words are like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body.</p>

When community members communicate through any of Missional Digerati's channels of communication, we want to be loving, respectful and constructive.  We will never accept any kind of personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.  We will not allow any form of harassment which may include but is not limited to offensive comments related to political belief, race, religion, religious denomination, disability, physical appearance, personal life choices, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and/or contains sexually explicit or violent material.  Our channels of communication include, but are not limited to GitHub issues and pull requests, files in our code repositories, social media platforms, forums, emails, web sites, mobile apps, and any live community events.

### Consequences

It is our hope that all community members would be willing to follow this Code of Conduct.  However, there are bound to be times when people decide to go against the policies of the community.  In case a situation like this arises,  Missional Digerati will do its due diligence to understand the situation and will evaluate whether discipline needs to be applied to the member.  This discipline can result in the following ways:

- **A Warning** - The individual will receive a warning by email in regards to their behavior.
- **Temporary Ban** - In a situation where the member continues this course of action, it will result in a temporary ban from the community.  For a set time, determined by the Missional Digerati team, the individual will be removed from all our projects, and restricted from any form of communication within the community.
- **Permanent Ban** - If the member continues this behavior, it will result in a permanent removal from the community.

In all of these situations, the individual will be asked to issue an apology to the person they offended, and seek reconciliation.  They will also be asked to remove any offensive material immediately.  Failure to do so may result in further action.

### In Closing

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center lead">
  <p class="mb-0">Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.</p>
