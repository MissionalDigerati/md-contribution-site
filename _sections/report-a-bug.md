## Report a Bug

Our community uses Github Issue Tracking to track bug reports, feature requests and questions related to a project.  You should visit the specific project's code repository to report the bug.  See the [projects section](#projects){:.scroll-to} above.  Once there, click on the _Issues_ tab.  **Before you submit the bug report, you should search the issue tracker for a similar issue.**  If you are unable to find a similar issue, then:

1. Click on the _New Issue_ button.
2. Click the _Get Started_ button next to **Bug Report**.

You will be presented with a template that will help guide you through reporting the bug.  In order for us to address the issue, we need as much details that you can provide.  At the bare minimum, please include the following:

- A title that contains the current date (MM/DD/YYYY) and a brief and concise description of the bug.
- A detailed description of the bug.
- Steps to reproduce the bug.

Once you have provided as much details as possible, and removed any template text that is not used, then click the _Submit new issue_ button.

    <p><i class="icon-picons-directions-2"></i> Please remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.</p>
