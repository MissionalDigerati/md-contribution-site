## Request a Feature

Our community uses GitHub Issue Tracking to track feature requests related to a project.  You should visit the specific project's code repository to request a feature.  See the [projects section](#projects){:.scroll-to} above.  Once there, click on the _Issues_ tab.  **Before you submit the feature request, you should search the issue tracker for a similar request.**  If you are unable to find a similar request, then:

1. Click on the _New Issue_ button.
2. Click the _Get Started_ button next to **Feature Request**.

You will be presented with a template that will help guide you through requesting the feature.  At the bare minimum, please include the following:

- A title that contains the current date (MM/DD/YYYY) and a brief and concise description of the feature.
- A detailed description of the feature.
- A reason why you think we should add the feature.

Once you have provided as much details as possible, and removed any template text that is not used, then click the _Submit new issue_ button.

<div class="alert bg-info text-black" role="info">
    <p><i class="icon-picons-directions-2"></i> Please be patient. We cannot implement every feature request that we receive. Sometimes you might get no response to your request, which means that everyone is indifferent to the idea. On the other hand, you might find someone who's also interested in building that feature.</p>
</div>

If a feature request receives no activity for an extended period of time, it will be labeled as **Archived**.
