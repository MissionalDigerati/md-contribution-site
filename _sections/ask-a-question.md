## Ask a Question

Our community uses GitHub Issue Tracking to track bug reports, feature requests and questions related to a project.  You should visit the specific project's code repository to ask a question.  See the [projects section](#projects){:.scroll-to} above.  Once there, click on the _Issues_ tab.  

**Before you submit a question, you should do the following:**

1. Search the issue tracker for a similar question.
2. Make sure the question has not been asked on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

If it has not been answered, then:

1. Click on the _New Issue_ button.
2. Click the _Get Started_ button next to **Questions?**.

You will be presented with a template that will help guide you through asking your question.  At the bare minimum, please include the following:

- A title that contains the current date (MM/DD/YYYY) and a brief and concise description of the question.
- Your question.

Once you have provided as much details as possible, and removed any template text that is not used, then click the _Submit new issue_ button.
