In order to contribute to any of the projects, you will first need to create a [free Github account](https://github.com/).  Once you have an account, you can visit each project's code repository using the *View Code* buttons above.  In each project's repository you will find:

* **Code**: All of the source code resides on Github, and is free for anyone to use.  As you will see later in this document, you can also submit updates to the code using a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
* **Issues**: The Issue Tracker provides the community a place to submit bug reports and feature requests.  The community members can also find issues that need help to fix.
* **Pull Requests**: This displays all pull requests submitted by the community, and any discussions related to the update.
* **Wiki**: The wiki contains project specific documentation, which may include setting up a development environment, creating plugin guides, and instructions on how to run tests locally.

If you are not familiar with Github, you may want to take a moment and browse one of the projects above.
