# What We Believe

### God

We believe in one unchangeable, infinite, and perfect God who is the creator of all things, and eternally exists in a fellowship of three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

### God the Father

We believe in God the Father, the first person of the Trinity.  We believe He is holy, just and good, and by His word and for His glory He freely created all things.  By His sovereign power He sustains, directs and rules over all things.

### Jesus Christ

We believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity.  We believe in His virgin birth,  sinless life, divine miracles, atoning death upon a cross, bodily resurrection, ascension and exaltation.  We also believe in His personal, visible and glorious return to Earth and the establishment of His kingdom.

### he Holy Spirit

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity.  We believe the Holy Spirit indwells in every believer, and continues to transform them more and more into the likeness of Christ. We believe the Holy Spirit is a constant helper, teacher and guide to the believer, and that He equips, and empowers them to Christian witness, and service for kingdom work.

### The Bible

We believe that the Bible, consisting of the Old and New Testaments, is the inspired Word of God.  We believe it is without error in the original manuscripts, and is our supreme, sufficient, and infallible authority in all matters of faith and conduct.

### Man

We believe that Adam and Eve, created in the image of God, were tempted by Satan, the god of this world, and fell; that their sin has passed to all people, who as a result are lost, unable to save themselves from the wrath of God, and need to be saved.

### Salvation

We believe that Jesus Christ, as our substitute,  shed His blood on a cross as the perfect, all-sufficient sacrifice for our sins.  We believe that those who repent, and believe in the death and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ will receive salvation from the wrath of God.

### The Resurrection

We believe in the bodily resurrection of both the saved and lost; they who are saved unto the resurrection of eternal life with God, they who are lost unto the resurrection of eternal condemnation separated from God.

### The Church

We believe the Church is a living spiritual body.  Christ is the head of that body and all true believers are its members.

### The Great Commission

We believe that Christ commanded the Church to go into all the world and make disciples of all peoples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching those who believe to obey all that Christ commanded.
